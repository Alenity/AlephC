# AlephC: The Real-Time Mathematic Visualizer

**AlephC** is an intelligent, real-time visualization engine that turns natural language queries into beautiful STEM animations. Inspired by the visual clarity of Manim and the computational intuition of WolframAlpha, AlephC allows you to "speak" your diagrams into existence.

## 🧠 The Concept

AlephC interprets human-readable commands and maps them to high-performance geometric and physical entities.

* **Input:** *"Draw a unit circle and show the sine wave derivation."*
* **Output:** An immediate, smooth animation rendered on a real-time canvas.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Semantic Command Engine:** No rigid syntax. AlephC parses natural language to understand mathematical intent.
* **Zero-Compile Workflow:** Animations appear instantly as you type, making it perfect for live classrooms and tutoring.
* **Dynamic STEM Modules:**
* **Mathematics:** Function plotting, calculus visualizations, and linear algebra transforms.
* **Physics (Coming Soon):** Real-time kinematics, field lines, and particle collisions.
* **Comp-Sci (Coming Soon):** Visualizing recursion, pointer logic, and complexity growth.


* **Interactive Toggles:** Tweak variables via sliders or follow-up commands (e.g., *"Make the frequency higher"*).

## 🛠️ How It Works

AlephC uses a custom-built rendering pipeline optimized for speed rather than pre-rendered video files.

1. **Input Layer:** User types a command (e.g., *"Graph  and tangent at "*).
2. **Parser:** The engine identifies the mathematical objects and the requested actions (Graph, Tangent).
3. **Canvas:** The engine updates the buffer and animates the transition in real-time.

## 🕹️ Examples

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `"Create a vector [3, 2]"` | Draws a vector from the origin to  |
| `"Rotate the square by 90 degrees"` | Executes a smooth rotational transformation |
| `"Show the Riemann sum for sin(x)"` | Generates rectangles under the curve dynamically |



## 🗺️ Roadmap

* [ ] **NLP Refinement:** Improving the parser to handle complex multi-step instructions.
* [ ] **Physics Integration:** Adding a 2D rigid-body solver for "active" animations.
* [ ] **CS Module:** Live data structure visualizations (linked lists, trees).
* [ ] **Voice-to-Canvas:** Integration with STT (Speech-to-Text) for truly hands-free explanations.
